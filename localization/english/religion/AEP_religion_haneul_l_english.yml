 haneul_religion_desc:1 "Korean Shamanism or Muism is Korea's native religion centered on the belief that the World is inhabited by spirits residing in the springs, trees, mountains, and other aspects of nature, sometimes also taking the form of animals or young women. These spirits are said to have originated from the sky, the chief among them being Haneul, the Lord of Heaven, whose son, Hwanung, was sent down to Mt. Taebaeksan to govern the Earthly realm. Hwanung would be assisted by the Palgeuinuri, or the World of Light, shaped by clouds, wind, and rain, to help him govern, and would go on to father Dangun Wanggeom, Korea's first king."
